% Bibliography style
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The bibliography really isn't optimal...
% Someone who knows how to modify .bbx files should have a look at custom-numeric-comp.bbx.
% I found that file on the web but did some modifications to it.
% I tried to add an Oxford comma to the bibliography but didn't succeed.
% (there's a dictionary for Oxford spelling in ./etc/ , needed that for an IOP article)
 
% Some citations to different sources are included in ch.2 (article, book, inbook, proceedings, etc.).
% A good alternative to biber is to use bibtex with the unsrturl.bst stylefile (back-refs don't work then).
