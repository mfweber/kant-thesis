%% IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH FLOATS UNCOMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINES
%
%% I didn't see any use for them in my documents.
%% maybe they are already integrated in the KOMA script?

%% Alter some LaTeX defaults for better treatment of figures:
%% See p.105 of "TeX Unbound" for suggested values.
%% See pp. 199-200 of Lamport's "LaTeX" book for details.
%
%%  General parameters, for ALL pages:
%\renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.9}%  max fraction of floats at top
%\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.8}%  max fraction of floats at bottom
%
%%  Parameters for TEXT pages (not float pages):
%\setcounter{topnumber}{1}
%\setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
%\setcounter{totalnumber}{4}%  2 may work better
%\setcounter{dbltopnumber}{2}%  for 2-column pages
%\renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.9}%  fit big float above 2-col. text
%\renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.07}%  allow minimal text w. figs
%%  Parameters for FLOAT pages (not text pages):
%\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.7}%  require fuller float pages
%%  N.B.: floatpagefraction MUST be less than topfraction !!
%\renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{0.7}%  require fuller float pages
%%  remember to use [htp] or [htpb] for placement
